		- This increasingly popular course is taught through the Data Science Center at NYU. Originally introduced by [Yann Lecun](http://yann.lecun.com/), it is now led by [Zaid Harchaoui](http://www.harchaoui.eu/), although Prof. Lecun is rumored to still stop by from time to time. It covers the theory, technique, and tricks that are used to achieve very high accuracy for machine learning tasks in computer vision and natural language processing.

		- The course presents the subject through a series of seminars and labs, which will explore it from its early beginnings, and work themselves to some of the state of the art. The seminars will cover the basics of deep learning and the underlying theory, as well as the breadth of application areas to which it has been applied, as well as the latest issues on learning from very large amounts of data. We will concentrate largely, although not entirely, on the connectionist architectures that are most commonly associated with it. *Lectures* and *Reading Notes* are available on the page.

		- Natural language processing (NLP) is one of the most important technologies of the information age. Understanding complex language utterances is also a crucial part of artificial intelligence. Applications of NLP are everywhere because people communicate most everything in language: web search, advertisement, emails, customer service, language translation, radiology reports, etc. There are a large variety of underlying tasks and machine learning models powering NLP applications. Recently, deep learning approaches have obtained very high performance across many different NLP tasks. These models can often be trained with a single end-to-end model and do not require traditional, task-specific feature engineering. In this spring quarter course students will learn to implement, train, debug, visualize and invent their own neural network models. The course provides a deep excursion into cutting-edge research in deep learning applied to NLP.

	- CS5540 is a masters-level course that covers a wide range of clinical problems and their associated computational challenges. The practice of medicine is filled with digitally accessible information about patients, ranging from EKG readings to MRI images to electronic health records. This poses a huge opportunity for computer tools that make sense out of this data. Computation tools can be used to answer seemingly straightforward questions about a single patient's test results (“Does this patient have a normal heart rhythm?”), or to address vital questions about large populations (“Is there any clinical condition that affects the risks of Alzheimer”). In CS5540 we will look at many of the most important sources of clinical data and discuss the basic computational techniques used for their analysis, ranging in sophistication from current clinical practice to state-of-the-art research projects.
