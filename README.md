		- In this one-semester survey course, we introduce numerical methods for solving linear and nonlinear equations, interpolating data, computing integrals, and solving differential equations, and we describe how to use these tools wisely (we hope!) when solving scientific problems.

	    -  This graduate course gives a broad introduction to complexity theory, including classical results and recent developments. Complexity theory aims to understand the power of efficient computation (when computational resources like time and space are limited). Many compelling conceptual questions arise in this context. Most of these questions are (surprisingly?) difficult and far from being resolved. Nevertheless, a lot of progress has been made toward understanding them (and also why they are difficult). We will learn about these advances in this course. A theme will be combinatorial constructions with random-like properties, e.g., expander graphs and error-correcting codes. Some examples:
		    -  Is finding a solution inherently more difficult than verifying it?
		    -  Do more computational resources mean more computing power?
	  	  -  Is it easier to find approximate solutions than exact ones?
	  	  -  Are randomized algorithms more powerful than deterministic ones?
		    -  Is it easier to solve problems in the average case than in the worst case?
		    -  Are quantum computers more powerful than classical ones?
