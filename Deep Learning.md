	    - The course focusses on neural networks and uses the [Torch](https://github.com/torch/torch7/wiki/Cheatsheet) deep learning library (implemented in Lua) for exercises and assignments. Topics include: logistic regression, back-propagation, convolutional neural networks, max-margin learning, siamese networks, recurrent neural networks, LSTMs, hand-writing with recurrent neural networks, variational autoencoders and image generation and reinforcement learning

		- This increasingly popular course is taught through the Data Science Center at NYU. Originally introduced by [Yann Lecun](http://yann.lecun.com/), it is now led by [Zaid Harchaoui](http://www.harchaoui.eu/), although Prof. Lecun is rumored to still stop by from time to time. It covers the theory, technique, and tricks that are used to achieve very high accuracy for machine learning tasks in computer vision and natural language processing. The assignments are in Lua and hosted on Kaggle.

		- The course presents the subject through a series of seminars and labs, which will explore it from its early beginnings, and work themselves to some of the state of the art. The seminars will cover the basics of deep learning and the underlying theory, as well as the breadth of application areas to which it has been applied, as well as the latest issues on learning from very large amounts of data. We will concentrate largely, although not entirely, on the connectionist architectures that are most commonly associated with it. *Lectures* and *Reading Notes* are available on the page.
	- [Neural Networks](http://info.usherbrooke.ca/hlarochelle/neural_networks/content.html) **Universit√© de Sherbrooke**
		+ This is a graduate-level course, which covers basic neural networks as well as more advanced topics, including: Deep learning, Conditional random fields, Restricted Boltzmann machines, Autoencoders, Sparse coding, Convolutional networks, Vector word representations.

		- Natural language processing (NLP) is one of the most important technologies of the information age. Understanding complex language utterances is also a crucial part of artificial intelligence. Applications of NLP are everywhere because people communicate most everything in language: web search, advertisement, emails, customer service, language translation, radiology reports, etc. There are a large variety of underlying tasks and machine learning models powering NLP applications. Recently, deep learning approaches have obtained very high performance across many different NLP tasks. These models can often be trained with a single end-to-end model and do not require traditional, task-specific feature engineering. In this spring quarter course students will learn to implement, train, debug, visualize and invent their own neural network models. The course provides a deep excursion into cutting-edge research in deep learning applied to NLP.

		- Computer Vision has become ubiquitous in our society, with applications in search, image understanding, apps, mapping, medicine, drones, and self-driving cars. This course is a deep dive into details of the deep learning architectures with a focus on learning end-to-end models for these tasks, particularly image classification. During the 10-week course, students will learn to implement, train and debug their own neural networks and gain a detailed understanding of cutting-edge research in computer vision.

		- This graduate level research class focuses on deep learning techniques for vision and natural language processing problems. It gives an overview of the various deep learning models and techniques, and surveys recent advances in the related fields. This course uses Theano as the main programminging tool. GPU programming experiences are preferred although not required. Frequent paper presentations and a heavy programming workload are expected.
